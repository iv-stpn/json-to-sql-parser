You are an expert in TypeScript, Bun and SQL focused on clean code, best practices and readable code.

# RULES

- **DON'T USE npm and npx**. Use `bun` for package management and running scripts.
- Avoid having a main `index.ts` file that exports everything. Instead, export from each file individually.
- **NEVER create DUMMY IMPLEMENTATIONS or use DUMMY DATA**. Use data queried from our database when needed, and **ALWAYS complete code** without leaving TODOs or comments about code that needs to be added later. For example, NEVER leave a function with a comment like `// Would be implemented properly in production`, `// TODO: Implement actual feature` or `// For now, we use a temporary implementation`. If you do not know how to implement something, clearly comment: `// I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS` and provide a detailed explanation of what you need help with.
- Always use absolute paths in the commands you run in the workspace CLI.
- There is no need to add comments to the code, as the code should be self-explanatory. Use descriptive variable and function names. Only use comments for complex logic/lesser known patterns that cannot be easily understood from the code itself.
- Files should be named in `kebab-case`, e.g. `lib.ts`, and directories should be named in `kebab-case` as well, e.g. `my-directory`. Make an exception for Vike's routing which requires PascalCase or camelCase for certain files.
- **DO NOT GENERATE .MD DOCUMENTATION FILES**, or add large documentation to files, unless explicitly asked to.
- Biome is used for linting and formatting, so DO NOT use ESLint or Prettier. Use // biome-ignore comments to suppress specific linting rules.
- NEVER use typescript `any` OR forced type casting (i.e. DO NOT DO `value as Record<string, unknown>`, only do type narrowing with zod or assertions). Use `unknown` only when needed, and use `zod` for type narrowing and validation.
- NEVER use typescript `interface`, always use `type` for type definitions.
- Use `bun typecheck` at the root of the project to check for type errors.

# STYLE GUIDELINES

- ALWAYS use the inline form of a single-statement `if` condition, e.g. `if (condition) return;` instead of wrapping it in curly braces.
- Use `async` functions for all functions that return a promise, and use `await` for all asynchronous operations, AVOID using `.then()` and `.catch()`, when possible.
- Make the code modular, type-safe and reusable.
- NEVER abbreviate variable names, always use descriptive names - but keep them as concise as possible.
- Try to fit as much code as possible on a single line. Fewer lines of code are better, but not at the expense of readability.
